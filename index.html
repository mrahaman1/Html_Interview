    <h1>HTML Interview Question</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>1. Difference between div and span</h2>
    <p>Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. However, they serve different functions. A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements, whereas a span element is used for inline organization and styling.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2. Difference between class and IDs</h2>
    <p>The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3. What are self closing tags</h2>
    <p>Some HTML tags (like img and br ) don't have their own content. These are known as self closing tags or empty tags. They look like this: A simple example: The br tag inserts a line break (not a paragraph break).</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3. How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where</h2>
    <p>HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.</p>
    <p>h1 to h3 use for heading and rest are use for sub-heading</p>
    <br>
    <h2>4. Difference between block and inline</h2>
    <p>Inline elements: Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.</p>
    <p>Block elements: They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency. They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>5. Difference between em and strong</h2>
    <p>The (strong) tag should be used to indicate strong importance, seriousness, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it. The (em) tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>6. What are attributes?</h2>
    <p>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
        <br>
        Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
        <br>
        Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
        <br>
        The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
        <br>
        The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only.
        <br>
        You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes.</p>
